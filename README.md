# First mini project

`npm i axios`

- Create index.ts file to fetch url [link](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1)

- Remember we cant execute code in ts file now we need to compile it first to give us JS code

`tsc index.ts`

now run code

`node index.js`

- instead of everytime we do
  `tsc index.ts`
  then
  `node index.js`
  we will use ts-node tool to combine both

`ts-node index.ts`

- Question here why typescript is handy here ?
- Run the code in index2.ts and check console
    we executed the code and didnt know there is bugs inside it
